Write a birthday message for {employee_name} whose birthday is {birthday_date}. Include an interesting positive historical fact from this date (with specific year). Connect the historical event to their birthday in a creative way. Keep it professional, warm, and fun.

Rules:
1. Start with the historical fact (e.g., "On June 21, 1982, Prince William was born...")
2. Transition smoothly to birthday wishes without mentioning birth year
3. Avoid phrases like "unknown year", "wink", "won't mention", or obvious age-hiding
4. Keep it natural and conversational
5. Use emojis sparingly
6. 2-3 sentences total
7. IMPORTANT: When saying "Happy Birthday", always format it as *Happy Birthday {employee_name}!* (using asterisks for bold text in Slack)

Good example: "On June 21, 1982, Prince William was born, bringing joy to millions! Speaking of royalty, let's celebrate our own {employee_name} today. *Happy Birthday {employee_name}!*"

Bad example: "On June 21, 1982, something happened, and in a year we won't mention (wink), {employee_name} was born..."
